Esrgan GUI for Windows 10 (.NET 4.5)

This program is meant to create a more seamless workflow when using an ESRGAN package. The GUI interfaces a DLL that has mutiple OpenCV command built in.

If an image has an alpha channel the program will remove the alpha channel before using ESRGAN and then adds the scalled alpha channel back to the new image once completer.

It assumes ESRGAN is located at C:\etp\esrgan and you already have python installed.
